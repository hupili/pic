<h1>pic</h1>

<p>This repo is used to host the pic of my blog:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog address: <a href="http://hupili.github.io">http://hupili.github.io</a></li>
<li>GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/hupili/pic">https://github.com/hupili/pic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I know it is not a good idea to use GitHub to host static content. 
However, it is the most convenient and safe way I can find now.</p>

<p>If I really have high PV in the future, I will try to move the contents. </p>
