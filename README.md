# pic

This repo is used to host the pic of my blog:

   * Blog address: <http://hupili.github.io>
   * GitHub repo: <https://github.com/hupili/pic>

I know it is not a good idea to use GitHub to host static content. 
However, it is the most convenient and safe way I can find now.

If I really have high PV in the future, I will try to move the contents.
